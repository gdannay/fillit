# fillit

A algorithm that arranges Tetriminos with each others in order to make
the smallest possible square.

The programm takes only one parameter, a file which contains a list of Tetriminos
to assemble. This file has a very specific format : every Tetrimino must exactly fit in a
4 by 4 chars square and all Tetrimino are separated by an newline each.
